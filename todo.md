### Important

 - [x] Make a basic plan of syntax and get some basic/easy shit done

 - [-] Further plan the syntax
 
 - [x] Decide whether or not I only use **C** or have C++ in there too
 
 - [x] Lex source into tokens

 - [ ] Parse tokens into AST (Tree containing data about the program)

 - [ ] Compile AST into assembly (x86_64?) or transpile into different language that then gets compiled (something like C)   

 - [ ] Decide whether or not to have SDL support (out of the box) or to make using some tools (such as Vulkan) easier with my language (by abstracting shit)

### Basic after finished main idea type shit
 - [ ] Get Logo's and Icon done and designed (Minimalist Goat Silhouette)
